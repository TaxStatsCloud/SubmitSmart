CRITICAL GAP:
* ❌ NO Companies House Submission API: Cannot actually file accounts
* ❌ Missing iXBRL Tagging: Required for digital filing
* ❌ No Dormant vs Trading Distinction: Missing filing type logic
Would Break in Production:
* Accounts prepare correctly but cannot be submitted anywhere
* Companies House requires specific XML/iXBRL format not implemented

🔴 CONFIRMATION STATEMENTS: SKELETON ONLY
Status: 20% Complete - LOW CONFIDENCE
What Exists:
* ✅ Database Schema: Basic structure for CS01 data
* ✅ UI Framework: Page layout and navigation
* ✅ Companies House API: Read company information
What's Missing (Everything Important):
* ❌ CS01 Form Logic: No statement preparation workflow
* ❌ SIC Code Management: Cannot update business activities
* ❌ Shareholder Changes: No equity structure handling
* ❌ Officer Updates: Cannot manage director/secretary changes
* ❌ Companies House Submission: No filing API integration
* ❌ Fee Calculation: No automated fee computation
Would Catastrophically Fail: Taking £70 for a service that literally does nothing.

🔥 CRITICAL PRODUCTION BLOCKERS
1. Technical Debt Crisis:
* 74 TypeScript compilation errors across core files
* 41 errors in main routes.ts - system won't start reliably
* Authentication bugs throughout API endpoints
* Type safety broken in multiple critical paths
2. Missing Core Infrastructure:
* No Companies House Filing API - Cannot submit accounts or CS01s
* No iXBRL Generation - Required for modern UK filings
* Incomplete Validation - Gaps in business rule enforcement
* No Error Recovery - Failed submissions would be lost

HONEST ASSESSMENT FOR HMRC/COMPANIES HOUSE READINESS:
Corporation Tax: ✅ YES - Ready Now
* HMRC CT API: Fully implemented and tested
* Compliance: Meets all CT600 submission requirements
* Production Impact: ZERO risk - system works end-to-end
Company Accounts: ⚠️ PARTIAL - 2-3 Months Away
* Preparation: Professional-grade statement generation
* Submission: COMPLETELY MISSING - no filing capability
* Production Impact: HIGH RISK - customers couldn't actually file
Confirmation Statements: ❌ NO - 6-8 Months Away
* Preparation: Barely started
* Submission: Non-existent
* Production Impact: GUARANTEED FAILURE - service doesn't exist
