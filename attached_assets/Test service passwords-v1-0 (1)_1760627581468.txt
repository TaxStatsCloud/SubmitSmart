Customers of HMRC online services choose their own passwords which they will use to access services.

The password rules are: 
•       Minimum length 8 characters [see note *]
•       Maximum length 128 characters 
•       Contain ANY UTF-8 character

* New passwords have a minimum length of 10 characters; older passwords exist which may have as few as 8 characters.

A number of passwords have been set up for use in the test services for software developers.  Between them, they provide a range of complexity, from short to long and from common to less common characters.
