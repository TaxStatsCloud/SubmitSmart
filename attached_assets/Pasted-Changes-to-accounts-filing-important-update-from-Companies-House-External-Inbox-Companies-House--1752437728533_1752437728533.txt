Companies House


This is an official email to your registered email address from Companies House. This email has been sent to all companies on our register.

This email provides an update on changes to how companies will file their annual accounts from 1 April 2027, including the need to use software and new reporting requirements.

From 1 April 2027, all companies will need to file their annual accounts using commercial software. This means we’ll be closing our web and paper-based systems for account filings on that date. Whether you file accounts yourself or through an accountant or agent, you’ll need to use software from that point forward.

We’re contacting you now to give you plenty of time to prepare – you’ll have one full accounting year, plus 9 months, to make the switch (a total of 21 months).

If you already file your accounts using software, you do not need to take any action.

What’s changing
From 1 April 2027:

accounts must be filed digitally using software – web and paper filing options for accounts will no longer be available from this date
profit and loss accounts will be required for small and micro-entity companies
other changes are planned, including updates to audit exemptions and accounting reference periods – we’ll share more information about these in the coming months
You’ll still be able to use our online services to file other documents like confirmation statements and director updates – these are not affected by this change.

Why these changes are happening
These changes are being introduced as part of a broader reform package under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023.

The move to software filing is a critical step in improving the accuracy and quality of data on the register by reducing errors and formatting issues. It will also speed up processing times and help Companies House detect and prevent fraud more effectively.

For companies, this change will streamline the filing process and offer a more secure way to submit your accounts compared to paper filings.

Making basic profit and loss information available on the register aims to improve conditions for accessing credit, including trade credit lending, as well as helping to provide confidence for those who want to do business with a company. It will also reduce the risk of deliberate misuse of minimal disclosure options to hide money laundering and other fraudulent activity.

We’ve published guidance on GOV.​UK to help companies make the switch to software filing and we’ll continue to provide guidance and support throughout the transition. We also recommend speaking to your accountant or software provider to make sure you’re ready.
