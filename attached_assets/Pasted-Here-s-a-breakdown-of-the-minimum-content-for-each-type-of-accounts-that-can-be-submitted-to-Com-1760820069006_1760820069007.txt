Here’s a **breakdown of the minimum content for each type of accounts** that can be submitted to Companies House in the UK:

**Micro-Entity Accounts (FRS 105):**
- **Balance sheet** (micro-entity format)
- **Income statement** (can be included, not mandatory for filing)
- **Footnotes:** Limited—only main notes are required: directors' details, registered office, accounting policy for micro-entity regime, and statement that audit is not needed.
- **No cash flow statement** required.
- **No directors’ report** required.

**Small Company Accounts (FRS 102 Section 1A):**
- **Balance sheet** with required notes 
- **Profit & loss account (income statement)**
- **Optional abridged accounts:** With member consent, fewer lines/disclosures.
- **Directors’ report**—unless exempt as micro-entity.
- **No cash flow statement required** if eligible
- **Notes**—simplified compared to large/medium companies.

**Medium-Sized and Large Company Accounts (FRS 102 or IFRS):**
- **Balance sheet**
- **Profit & loss account (income statement)**
- **Cash flow statement** (mandatory)
- **Directors’ report**
- **Strategic report** (for large companies)
- **Full notes to the accounts** in compliance with UK GAAP or IFRS
- **Audit report**—required unless exempt

**Dormant Company Accounts:**
- **Balance sheet** (showing zero activity except permitted transactions)
- **Notes about status** (main liability = share capital or permitted transactions)
- **No income statement or cash flow statement** required

**Key Points for Choosing Your Accounts Format:**
- The size/status of your company determines what you must include.
- Micro-entity and small companies qualify for most simplifications.
- Medium/large accounts require full disclosures and external audit.
- Dormant companies file extremely minimal accounts.

**If you tell me your company’s size/status or special circumstances (e.g. parent company, subsidiary, dormant, listed), I can give even more specific guidance!**
