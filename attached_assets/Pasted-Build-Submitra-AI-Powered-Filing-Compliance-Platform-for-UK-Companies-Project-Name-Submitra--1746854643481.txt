Build “Submitra” — AI-Powered Filing & Compliance Platform for UK Companies

Project Name:
Submitra – Intelligent automation for company filings, accounts, and Corporation Tax returns in the UK.

Mission:

Build an AI-powered web application that helps UK-based companies file their Confirmation Statements, Annual Accounts, and Corporation Tax returns (CT600) in a seamless, fast-tracked, and compliant manner. The application should support automated drafting from documents, trial balances, and transaction templates, support user review and accountant sign-off, and ensure compliance with UK GAAP, IFRS, Companies House, and HMRC standards.
