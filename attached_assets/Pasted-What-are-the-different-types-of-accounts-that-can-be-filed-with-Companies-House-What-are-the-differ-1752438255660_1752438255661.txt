Types of Accounts Filed with Companies House
Companies House requires all registered companies in the UK to file annual accounts. The type of accounts you need to file depends on your company’s size and status. Below are the main types:

1. Micro-Entity Accounts
For very small companies.

Must meet at least 2 of the following:

Turnover: no more than £632,000

Balance sheet total: no more than £316,000

Average number of employees: no more than 10

These accounts are highly simplified, requiring only a basic balance sheet and minimal notes.

2. Small Company (Abridged) Accounts
For companies that meet at least 2 of the following:

Turnover: no more than £10.2 million

Balance sheet total: no more than £5.1 million

Average number of employees: no more than 50

Abridged accounts are a simplified version of full accounts and do not require a full profit and loss account or a directors’ report to be filed with Companies House.

3. Full (Statutory) Accounts
Required for medium and large companies, or if a company chooses not to file abridged or micro-entity accounts.

Must include:

Balance sheet

Profit and loss account

Notes to the accounts

Directors’ report

Auditor’s report (unless exempt)

These provide the most comprehensive financial picture of the company.

4. Dormant Company Accounts
For companies that have had no ‘significant’ transactions during the financial year.

Only a balance sheet and limited notes are required.

Dormant companies do not need to file a profit and loss account or directors’ report.
