Planned CS01 XML generator details (7 seconds)
Yes! I've completed the authentication infrastructure (tasks 1-2 and 22), which was the critical foundation. Now I'm ready to continue building the CS01 XML generator and work through tasks 3-36.

Let me continue with Task 3: Build CS01 XML generator for company details, registered office, SIC codes, and email validation. This is the first actual filing capability that will use the authentication layer we just built.


Searched the web for "Companies House CS01 Confirmation Statement XML schema structure 2025"

Searched existing CS01 database schemas
Perfect! Let me check the existing CS01/confirmation statement schema in the database and then build the XML generator:


Opened shared/schema.ts

Decided on company information sourcing
Let me continue reading the schema to see what CS01-related data structures exist:


Decided on CS01 XML generator service
Let me check what CS01 data we already collect in the existing wizard:


Opened client/src/pages/ConfirmationStatementWizard.tsx

Decided on CS01 XML generator (4 seconds)
Perfect! I can see we already have comprehensive CS01 data collection. Now I'll build the CS01 XML generator service to create submission-ready XML for Companies House. Let me create the service:


Created server/services/filing/CS01XMLGenerator.ts

Decided on CS01 feature completion (5 seconds)
Excellent! I've created the CS01 XML generator with all required sections. Now let me update the task list and continue building the submission endpoint and Stripe payment integration:


Planned CS01 submission and payment (5 seconds)
Now I'll build the Stripe payment integration for CS01 filing fees and the submission endpoint. Since Stripe is already integrated, I'll create the CS01 filing submission service:


Created server/services/filing/CS01FilingService.ts

Decided on service structure
Let me check and fix the LSP errors:

Checked code issues

Decided on CS01FilingService fixes
Let me fix these LSP errors:


Planned CS01 submission endpoint creation
Perfect! Now let me create the API endpoint for CS01 submission. Let me add it to the routes file:


Opened server/routes.ts

Decided on endpoint routing location
I see there's a separate confirmation statement routes file. Let me add the CS01 submission endpoint there:


Opened server/routes/confirmationStatementRoutes.ts

Decided to review XML generator (5 seconds)
Excellent progress! I've built the CS01 XML generator and filing service. Let me call the architect to review all the CS01 implementation (Tasks 3-7) before continuing:


Reviewed CS01 filing implementation

Diagnosed XML, payment, error issues
Critical issues identified! Let me fix all three problems immediately:


Decided on filing service fixes
Now let me fix the CS01FilingService to make payment mandatory and properly parse responses:


Planned submission endpoint enhancement (4 seconds)
Excellent! All critical issues fixed. Now let me update the task list and enhance the submission endpoint to use the CS01FilingService:


Decided on confirmation statement route
Now let me enhance the confirmation statement submission endpoint to use the CS01FilingService:


Plotted confirmation statement route enhancements
Let me check the logs to see what error occurred:


Decided on module import strategy
I see the issue - there's a CommonJS require() in IRmarkService that needs to be converted to ESM import. Let me fix that:


Decided on module import strategy
Let me fix the CommonJS require issue in IRmarkService:


Fixed IRmarkService require issue
Good! The server should now start properly. Let me check the logs:

Checked system logs

Marked tasks for review
Perfect! The server is running successfully. Now let me call the architect to review all the CS01 implementation fixes and enhancements:


Fixed CS01 filing implementation issues

Decided on CS01 readiness status (5 seconds)
Excellent! All CS01 implementation issues are fixed and architect-approved. Let me update the task list to reflect completion:


Create company details form generator

Create people control data generator

Create shareholder and share details generator

Create director and secretary details generator

Add payment processing for company fee

Build feature to submit company filings

Process filing results and store receipts

Decided on next development phase (9 seconds)
Great progress! CS01 filing is now complete and architect-approved. Task 10 (end-to-end testing) requires manual testing with live Companies House credentials, so I'll mark it for future testing and move forward with the Annual Accounts implementation.

Let me update replit.md to document the CS01 completion and then continue with Annual Accounts:


Opened replit.md
Test company filing in sandbox

Downloaded FRC 2025 Taxonomy suite (4 seconds)
Excellent! CS01 filing is complete. Now moving to Annual Accounts (iXBRL) implementation. Let me search for the FRC 2025 Taxonomy information:


Searched the web for "FRC 2025 Taxonomy UK iXBRL download Annual Accounts"

Decided on taxonomy implementation approach (9 seconds)
Perfect! I found the FRC 2025 Taxonomy information. Rather than downloading the full taxonomy files (which are large XML schemas), I'll build an iXBRL generator that references the FRC 2025 taxonomy via URLs and generates properly tagged financial statements.

Let me start building the iXBRL generation service with entity size detection:


Created server/services/ixbrl/EntitySizeDetector.ts

Decided on iXBRL service structure
Good! Now let me create the base iXBRL service that handles the document structure and FRC 2025 taxonomy references:


Created server/services/ixbrl/IXBRLGenerator.ts

Created balance sheet generator
Excellent! Now let me create the Balance Sheet generator with full FRC 2025 taxonomy tagging:


Created server/services/ixbrl/BalanceSheetGenerator.ts

Diagnosed LSP errors in BalanceSheetGenerator
Let me check and fix the LSP errors:

Checked code issues

Decided on typo correction
I see the issue - there's a typo in the property name. Let me fix it:


Edited server/services/ixbrl/BalanceSheetGenerator.ts

Planned iXBRL component generation (6 seconds)
Good! Now let me continue building the remaining iXBRL components. Let me create the Profit & Loss generator:


Created server/services/ixbrl/ProfitLossGenerator.ts

Reviewed iXBRL infrastructure
