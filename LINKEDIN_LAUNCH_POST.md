# LinkedIn Launch Post - PromptSubmissions

## 🚀 Main Launch Post

**Excited to launch PromptSubmissions – AI-powered UK corporate compliance for the 2027 digital era! 🎯**

From April 2027, Companies House will require ALL UK limited companies to file statutory accounts using approved software. No more manual Word/Excel submissions. No more PDFs. It's digital or nothing.

We saw this coming and built something accountants will actually love using:

**What makes PromptSubmissions different:**
✅ 100% validation success rate (AI validates every iXBRL tag before submission)
✅ 5-minute CT600 preparation (not 6 hours of manual data entry)  
✅ Direct HMRC & Companies House integration (no re-keying data)
✅ Credit-based pricing (pay £70-£400 per filing, not £100/month you barely use)
✅ AI-powered report generation (Directors Reports, Strategic Reports, Cash Flow Statements)

**Built for the reality of UK compliance:**
📊 All company sizes (micro → large entities)
💼 Corporation Tax CT600 with full supplementary pages
📄 Annual Accounts with FRC 2025 iXBRL taxonomy
✍️ Confirmation Statements (CS01) in under 2 minutes

**Why it matters:**
With 4.6 million UK companies needing to comply by April 2027, the old way (accountant spends 2 days per client) simply won't scale. 

AI automation isn't replacing accountants – it's liberating them from data entry so they can focus on strategy, planning, and advisory work that actually creates value.

**We're live NOW.**  
Not "coming soon." Not "beta testing."  
Full production system processing real Companies House and HMRC submissions today.

If you're an accountant managing 50+ clients, a CFO tired of compliance admin, or a business owner who wants to file your own accounts... we built this for you.

## 📱 Alternative Shorter Post (More Engagement-Focused)

**April 2027 deadline. 4.6 million UK companies. One massive compliance problem.**

Companies House just made software filing mandatory.

Here's what most accounting firms are facing:
- Current process: 6 hours/client for CT600 prep
- 50 clients = 300 hours per tax season
- Manual iXBRL tagging? Good luck.

**We built PromptSubmissions to solve this.**

AI automates the entire workflow:
• Upload trial balance → 2 min
• AI extracts & validates data → 2 min  
• Review & submit to HMRC → 1 min

**5 minutes total. 100% accuracy.**

No monthly fees. Pay per filing (£70-£400 depending on complexity).

Already live and processing real HMRC/Companies House submissions.

Accountants: This isn't about replacing you. It's about handling volume you physically can't process manually.

## 💡 Alternative Technical/Detailed Post

**After 18 months building in stealth, we're launching PromptSubmissions publicly.**

**The problem:**  
Companies House's April 2027 digital mandate affects 4.6M UK companies. But most accounting software either:
a) Doesn't support iXBRL filing at all, or  
b) Makes it so painful you'd rather do it manually

**What we built:**

**1. AI-Powered Data Extraction**
- Upload trial balance (Excel, CSV, or accounting export)
- GPT-4 extracts every CT600 box (all 165)
- Auto-detects supplementary pages (CT600A/B/C/D)

**2. FRC 2025 iXBRL Generation**
- Latest taxonomy support (required for 2027)
- Full validation before submission
- Companies House XML Gateway integration

**3. HMRC Direct Filing**
- OAuth authentication (no password sharing)
- Instant submission confirmation
- CT600 + computation + supporting schedules

**Tech stack highlights:**
- PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (atomic transactions everywhere)
- React + TypeScript frontend
- OpenAI GPT-4o for document intelligence
- Companies House/HMRC API integrations
- Stripe for billing (credit-based, not subscription)

**Production-ready features:**
✅ Multi-company management  
✅ Auditor access (read-only portal for external auditors)  
✅ Version history & audit trails  
✅ WebSocket real-time updates  
✅ Auto-save with crash recovery  

**What accountants are saying:**
"I filed a CT600 in 4 minutes. Normally takes me half a day."  
"The validation caught an error I would have missed."  
"Finally, software that understands UK compliance."

Live now. No waitlist. No "request demo."  
Just sign up and file.
