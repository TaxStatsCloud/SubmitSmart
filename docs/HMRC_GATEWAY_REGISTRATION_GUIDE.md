## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Error 1046 - Authentication Error

**Possible causes:**

   - *Solution:* Verify credentials are exactly as created (case-sensitive)
   - *Reset if needed:* https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/account-recovery/

2. ❌ Corporation Tax service not activated yet
   - *Solution:* Check "Your account" to see if service shows as active
