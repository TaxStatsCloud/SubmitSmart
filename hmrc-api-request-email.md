**XML API Requirements:**
We are requesting access to the Corporation Tax Online XML API to develop a comprehensive AI-powered corporate compliance platform called "PromptSubmissions". Our software will provide automated corporation tax return preparation and submission services for UK companies.

**Business Context:**
With the upcoming mandatory software filing requirements for company accounts (effective April 2027), we are developing a solution to help UK companies meet their compliance obligations. Our platform will specifically focus on:

- Automated CT600 corporation tax return preparation
- AI-powered document processing and data extraction
- Streamlined filing workflows for accountants and businesses
- Support for dissolved company final returns and complex filing scenarios

**Technical Requirements:**
We require access to the Corporation Tax Online XML API to:
1. Submit CT600 returns with iXBRL formatted accounts and tax computations
2. Handle both standard and final/cessation returns
3. Process acknowledgments and error responses
4. Provide real-time filing status updates to users

**Target Market:**
Our platform will serve the 4.8+ million UK companies affected by the 2027 digital transformation, with particular focus on:
- Stage 1: Dormant and micro-entity companies (simple filings)
- Stage 2: Small companies with new P&L requirements
- Stage 3: Medium/large companies requiring complex filings

**Development Timeline:**
We are currently in active development with a planned beta launch in Q4 2025, ahead of the April 2027 mandatory filing deadline.

**Technical Compliance:**
Our development team has experience with:
- iXBRL formatting and validation
- XML API integration and error handling
- Secure credential management and data protection
- HMRC's GovTalkMessage format and submission protocols

We would be grateful for your guidance on the next steps for obtaining production access to the Corporation Tax Online XML API, including any vendor registration requirements or technical assessments needed.
